# Drum Machine

This started out as a fun experiment to control animation with audio inputs. I first learned how to make the drum sampler, then the custom video player, and that's when the two became one. I plan to scale this up in the next few months, as a medium to share my music and art in a truly interactive way.

### Users will be able to:

- select samples from a sound repository
- record layers of drum patterns
- edit individual layers
- share their recordings
- play on a mobile device

### To load up the Drum Machine

I'm using Parcel Bundler to keep things tidy.

- npm i
- npm start

#### play - https://techture.github.io/drum-machine/
