# Drum Machine
This project began as an engaging experiment to synchronize animation with audio inputs. It evolved from a simple drum sampler to a custom video player, eventually merging these elements to create an interactive platform. The vision is to expand this project, offering a unique medium to share music and art interactively. Users of the Drum Machine can use their keyboard to play a drum kit and control the playback of a video clip.
